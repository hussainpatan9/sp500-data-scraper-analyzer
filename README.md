## Detailed Workflow

### 1. Scrape S&P 500 Data

The `scrape_sp500()` function scrapes the top 50 S&P 500 companies from [SlickCharts](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500). It extracts the ticker symbols and company names.

### 2. Fetch Data from Yahoo Finance

The `scrape_yahoo_finance(ticker)` function fetches the following data for a given ticker:

- **Profile Data**: Country, Industry, Stock Exchange
- **Statistics Data**: Forward P/E and P/E Difference
- **Historical Data**: Daily closing prices for 2023

### 3. Fetch Data from MarketBeat

The `scrape_marketbeat_data(ticker, exchange)` function retrieves:

- Analyst Rating
- Upside/Downside
- News Sentiment

### 4. Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Combine Data**: Data from Yahoo Finance and MarketBeat is combined into a single DataFrame.
- **Filter "Buy" Ratings**: Stocks with "Buy" ratings are filtered and saved to `buy_ratings.xlsx`.
- **Plot Prices**: Daily closing prices for each industry are plotted, with annotations for maximum and minimum prices. Plots are saved in the `plots/` directory.

### 5. Save Results

- Combined data is saved to `combined_data.xlsx`.
- Filtered "Buy" ratings are saved to `buy_ratings.xlsx`.
